# Boilerplate Files

These are templates and configurations that I have created and use in various of my projects and deployments. They are based solely on Docker & Docker Compose for the moment however there will be many updates in the future.

I have created this as a repository of free resources to guide you on how you can host the included services on your own infrastructure whether it be your old dusty computer or a homelab of many servers.

# Warning

⚠️ Please be warned that the services that are referenced in the files in this repository can update, change or deprecate at any time. I will do my best to keep up with all of the latest changes but I cannot guarantee that this will be the case 100% of the time.

# Support

If you would like to contribute to this little project of mine, feel free to create a pull request with your additions/changes and I'll do my best to review and incorporate your additions/changes as soon as possible.

If you notice any issues with any of the files in this repository, please either create a pull request with your changes or submit an issue and I'll look into it as soon as possible.
